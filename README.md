# Popularity-Based Recommendation System

## Introduction

This Python project implements a popularity-based recommendation system for book recommendations. It identifies popular books based on the number of ratings and average ratings from a dataset of books, users, and ratings. The system provides a list of popular books that users might find interesting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need Python and the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## Results
The recommendation system will generate a list of the top popular books based on the number of ratings and average ratings. You can customize the number of ratings threshold and the number of books to display.
